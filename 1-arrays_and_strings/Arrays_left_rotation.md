What the Problem Is

You're given:

An integer array a of size n.

An integer d, representing the number of left rotations to perform.

A left rotation shifts each element of the array one position to the left, and the leftmost element wraps around to the end. If you perform this operation d times, what's the resulting array?

Example:

n = 5, d = 4  
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Performing 4 left rotations yields:

[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]

###  Common Approaches & Tips

Here are a few popular methods to tackle the problem efficiently:

#### 1. **Modular Indexing (Avoid Rotating at All)** – *Elegant & Efficient*

Instead of rotating step-by-step, compute the result directly. One great approach from Stack Overflow:

```java
static int[] rotLeft(int[] a, int d) {
    int[] b = new int[a.length];
    for (int s = d, t = 0; t < a.length; s++, t++) {
        b[t] = a[s % a.length];
    }
    return b;
}
```


Here, s is the source index (with wrap-around via modulo), and t is the target index in the result array.

2. Optimized Chunk Approach – O(n) Time, O(k) Space

Compute effective rotations = d % n (since rotating n times gets you back to the original array)

Copy the first d elements into a temporary buffer.

Shift the remainder of the array left by d.

Append the buffered elements to the end.

This uses O(n) time and O(d) extra space.

3. Reverse Trick

A clever in-place method:

Reverse the entire array.

Reverse the first n - d elements.

Reverse the last d elements.

This achieves the rotation in O(n) time using only constant extra space.

4. Language-Specific Shortcuts (e.g., Python slicing)

In Python, a very concise and efficient solution is:

```
def rotLeft(arr, d):
    return arr[d:] + arr[:d]
```

This slices and concatenates the array—simple and O(n) time.

Discussion boards also show similar slicing-based Python and JS solutions using loops or array methods like shift/push.

Why This Problem Matters in Interviews

Time Complexity Awareness: Naive “shift one at a time” is O(n·d) and inefficient.

Use of Modulo Arithmetic: Demonstrates understanding of circular indexing.

Multiple Solutions: Offers room to discuss space vs. time trade-offs or in-place techniques.

Language Knowledge: Highlights use of convenient built-in features like slicing or array utilities.
