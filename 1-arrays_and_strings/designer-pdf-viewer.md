### Example Chatgpt solution
```aiignore
size = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
word = input().strip()
heights = [size[ord(c) - ord('a')] for c in word]
print(max(heights) * len(word))
```

🔍 Clarifying Input/Output

Input format

“We’re given 26 integers for the heights — can I assume they’re always in order from a through z?”

“Are the heights guaranteed to be positive integers? Or could we get zeros/negatives?”

Word constraints

“Is the word always lowercase letters, or do I need to handle uppercase/mixed case?”

“What’s the maximum length of the word? Could it be thousands of characters?”

Output

“The output is just the area, right? So I only need to return one integer.”

📐 Problem Understanding

“Each letter is exactly one unit wide, so the total width is just the word’s length.”

“The height is determined by the tallest letter in the word.”

“So the area is simply maxHeight × wordLength.”

⚡ Algorithm / Approach

“I’ll need a quick way to map a letter to its height. Since a–z maps directly to indexes 0–25, I can use ord(char) - ord('a') (or ASCII math) for constant-time lookup.”

“So the problem boils down to scanning the word, finding the max height, and multiplying it by the length of the word.”

🧩 Edge Cases to Ask/Think About

“What if the word is just one letter? Then the width is 1, and the area equals that letter’s height.”

“What if the word is very long (say 10⁵ characters)? My algorithm is still O(n), so it’s efficient enough.”

“Could the word be empty? If so, should I return 0?”

“Do I need to validate inputs, or can I assume they follow the problem constraints?”

💻 Implementation Considerations

“I’ll store the heights in an array of length 26. That’s O(1) memory.”

“I only need one pass through the word, so time complexity is O(n).”

“The multiplication won’t overflow in normal constraints, but if heights and word length are large (say 10⁹ each), I should consider using a long/int64.”

🗣️ Example “Thinking Out Loud” Flow

If you were speaking in an interview, it might sound like this:

“Okay, so I get an array of 26 integers representing the heights of a through z. Then I get a word made up of lowercase letters. Each letter is one unit wide, and the highlight’s height is equal to the tallest letter in the word. So the area is simply the tallest letter’s height times the word’s length.
I’ll map letters to indices using ord(char) - ord('a') for O(1) lookup. Then, I’ll iterate through the word once, track the max height, and finally multiply by the word length. That’s O(n) time and O(1) extra space. Do I need to consider uppercase or empty words as input, or are inputs guaranteed to be lowercase and non-empty?”
